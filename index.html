                <dt><strong>When will my order arrive?</strong></dt>
                    <dd>You can expect your cookies within 2 to 5 business days of the order 
                        being processed. We do our best to get your order out as fast as possible!
                    </dd>
                
                <dt><strong>How many cookies can I order?</strong></dt>
                    <dd>As many as you like! Keep in mind that the more cookies you order, 
                        the longer it will take Nana to make and bake them for you.
                    </dd>

                <dt><strong>Is Nana the only one making cookies?</strong></dt>
                    <dd>Nana makes all of the cookie recipes herself, that's where the cookie 
                        magic comes from! She does have a couple of great helpers when baking 
                        though. One Nana can only do so much at once!
